**Next Steps**
1. Gather all the necessary documents related to the property ownership, including deeds, sale agreements, and any other proof of your share in the property.

## Scenario 7: Contracts

**Query**: "I lent money to a friend verbally. Is this agreement valid in court?"

**Expected Intent**: Contract validity / evidence

### Generated Response

**Summary**
Your verbal agreement to lend money to a friend could be considered valid in a Nepali court if certain conditions are met, but it's not automatically legally binding without a written agreement.

**Next Steps**
1. Consider writing a simple agreement with your friend detailing the terms of the loan.
2. Keep records of all communications related to the loan, such as emails or text messages, to help prove the agreement in case of a dispute.
